# awesome-ddev
A resource tracking DDEV-Local tips, tricks, solutions, blogs, and services

Remember the [regular ddev docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/ddev) and [ddev-contrib](https://github.com/drud/ddev-contrib). [See support in the docs too](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#support).

People all over the world are using the [DDEV-Local](https://github.com/drud/ddev) local development tool in incredibly creative ways. They're blogging about it, finding creative solutions to new challenges, inventing new approaches.

This repository is a curated set of links to external resources regarding DDEV-Local.

Your contributions are welcome, just open a PR with the items you'd like to add. This will obviously have to be reorganized from time to time, so your suggestions on that are also welcome.

Please don't be offended if your important link was initially left out, just do a PR. This has been a long time coming, so some important resources will have been neglected.
